# Amazon Archived Orders Restoration

Tampermonkey userscript that restores the **Archived Orders** functionality on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com).

âœ¨ Features:
- Restores the missing **"Archived Orders"** tab at the top of the *Your Orders* page.
- Adds an **"Archive Order"** link next to each order (next to "View order details" and "View invoice"), which opens Amazonâ€™s hidden archive modal for that order.

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager extension:

3. Open the [Amazon Your Orders page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history).  
   You should now see:

## Notes

- This script depends on Amazonâ€™s current internal archive URLs, which are still active but may be removed by Amazon at any time.  
- If those endpoints are disabled in the future, this script will no longer function.
