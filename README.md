# amazon-archived-orders
Tampermonkey userscript to restore the archived orders functionality on amazon.com

Instructions:
- Install the Tampermonkey extension into your browser
- Import the file Amazon_Archived_Orders_Restoration.user.js into Tampermonkey (Dashboard > Utilities > Import from file)
- Open the Amazon "Your Orders" page (https://www.amazon.com/gp/your-account/order-history) and there should be new links available on the page... a link for "Archived Orders" at the top and a link in each order for "Archive Order"

This relies on URLs that currently still exist but Amazon will likely remove them at some point...after which this script will no longer function
